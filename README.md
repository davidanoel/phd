1. To run all experiments, first install the following libraries if not already done so:
* Python 3.10 (Recommended: Anaconda)
* TensorFlow 2.10
* Keras
* Pandas
* Scikit-Learn
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
2. Clone the repository to a folder on the local machine. 
3. Open the notebook of interest and run using Python. 
   *To replicate the experiments, execute the spatial_invariance.ipynb notebook. 
   *To generate and train the cDCGAN, execute Conditional DCGAN.ipynb.
   *To perform analytics on the results, execute analysis.ipynb. 

##It should be noted that running the experiments or training the cDCGAN could take several hours depending on the speed of the computer being used.
